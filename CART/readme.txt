HOW TO RUN:
	a. Terminal (MacOS)
		1. Open 'Terminal'.
		2. Type 'ls' to see where the current directory is. 
		3. If the current directory is not the one in which the python file is, type: 
		cd /users/.../ 
		to reach the correct directory. Then press 'enter'.
		4. Once in the correct directory, run the python file by typing:
		python3 [file_name].py
		Then press 'enter'.
	b. Python's IDLE
		1. Open Python's 'IDLE'.
		2. Press Ctrl+O to open the python file. 
		3. In the python file window, press F5.

HOW TO TERMINATE
	We did not assign any special key to terminate our program. 
	To quit my programs (when it still runs), press Ctrl+C for both Terminal and IDLE. (Remark for Mac users: control+C, not command+C.)
	Programs will be terminated with KeyboardInterrupt. 

OTHER REMARKS:
	Please make sure the file train.csv and test.csv is in the same folder as the source code main.py before running the source code.
